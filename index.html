        <td class="table1">In this summer intern I am working on ICT support at MOL (Hong Kong) Ltd and this is a great work experience. I learned a lot of practical knowledge from the internship and deepened my understanding of ICT support. My responsibilities are the lower-level technical personnel, solving the known problems, and to fulfill service requests on the company office employees. In addition to daily ICT support tasks, I also apply my programming skills to my work. I am very excited because I can learn how to develop a website. For example, using the CSS & HTML code to design the website. Although the website was not published in the end due to the time limited, I learned a lot of web development skills in the process.</td>

        <td class="table2">I think the biggest challenge for an internship is to face all different colleagues and then solve their problems. It needs to communicate with people of different personalities and classes. Therefore, my communication skills have improved a lot. Sometimes, I think knowledge is not the most important thing, but how to get along with people. This will help you work in a comfortable environment. Be a polite, humble, and responsible person. This is my biggest gain during the internship.</td>
